Let's talk about How HTML Work & How we write. HTML stands for hypertext markup language. When using HTML, we should keep in mind that every HTML element requires an opening & closing bracket. But there are some exceptions, such as [<br>, <hr>, <img>, <link>] etc. Tags like this are self-closing. This tag should be started with < this, then followed by your element argument, followed by> let's write it together \"<html> \" This is an opening tag. This tag should now be closed using the \"/\" symbol. What's the best way to do it? After the first bracket, we need to add \"/\" ,then followed by your element argument, followed by> let's write it together </html> This is the closing tag.

Attributes are used to provide additional information about HTML elements. You will learn more about attributes in a later chapter. HTML Images HTML images are defined with the  <img>  tag We use (src) for source file. We use (alt) for alternative text. We use (width) for width of image. We use (height) for height of image. We use (title) for title of image. HTML < img src = \"html-org-in.png\"  alt = \"html.org.in\"  width = \"250\"  height = \"250\"  > Html Media tag There are some special tags which are used to add Videos & Audios in your Html page! You can add videos in your HTML page using the <video> tag HTML < video  controls > \n < source  src = \"your file.mp4\" > \n </ video > By the use of this tag you'll get some features in your video like: Play/Pause Volume Fullscreen etc. Similarly, you can add audios in your HTML page using the <audio> tag HTML < audio  controls > \n < source  src = \"your file.mp3\" > \n </ audio > That's all for this lesson, see you next one."

The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to: HTML < a  href = \"https://www.html.org.in\" >Go to HTML.ORG.IN</ a > Let's talk about Download file when clicking on the link (instead of navigating to the file) tag The download inside the a tag specifies that the target (the file specified in the href attribute) will be downloaded when a user clicks on the hyperlink.

Absolute URL is a URL that starts with http:// or https://, Links to an external image that is hosted on another website. Note:- Maybe you don't own the copyright of the image & Then if you use this image, you may be violated copyright law. 2.   Relative URL: ./html-img/a       Now question is, What is relative URL?       Relative URL is a URL that starts with ./ or ../, Links to an image that is hosted on the same website. Tip:- If you ask me I'll recommend you to use a relative URL. Because in the future you may want to move your website to another domain, Then your website will never break. Let's talk about alt tag The <img> tag defines an image. The alt attribute specifies an alternate text for the image, if the image cannot be displayed: HTML < img  src = \"https://www.html.org.in/img-1.png\"  alt = \"HTML.ORG.IN\" > Note:- The alt attribute is used to specify an alternate text for an image, if the image cannot be displayed. Let's talk about title tag The <img> tag defines an image. The title attribute specifies extra information about the image: HTML < img  src = \"https://www.html.org.in/img-1.png\"  alt = \"HTML.ORG.IN\"  title = \"HTML.ORG.IN\" > Note:- The title attribute is used to specify extra information about an image.

Okay as we all know, the heading is the title of the page. Now maybe you have a question why so many headings are there on the web page? Well, when a search engine indexes a web page/website, it will index that web page according to that heading. That means that will structure and content base on the heading. So I think you understand why the heading play a big role in a website. Note:- Each HTML heading has a default size, But you can change the size using  font-size  property.

Example:- HTML < p > This is a paragraph number one. < /p > \n < p > This is a paragraph number two. < /p > \n < p > This is a paragraph number three. < /p > Result HTML Display When it comes to display, You cannot arrange them using extra space or create a new line. In short, you can not do anything in this way. BUT! Don't worry we will fix that up in our upcoming lectures. The is really a beautiful way to fix this. Not right now. Example:- HTML < p > Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. \n         Quo quas natus esse ea magnam expedita, neque eos illum molestias, \n eaque, dolorem architecto explicabo tempora dolores saepe \n                  eveniet aut quam adipisci. \n </ p > HTML < p >   \n     Lorem  ipsum  dolor  sit  amet              consectetur  adipisicing  elit. \n     Quo  quas  natus  esse  ea  magnam    expedita,  neque  eos  illum  molestias, \n     eaque,  dolorem             architecto  explicabo  tempora  dolores  saepe \n     eveniet  aut  quam                                             adipisci. \n < /p > As you can see we create two paragraphs with a different styles.

Now it's time practically apply time Let me right down a simple example. HTML < p style = \"color:red;\" > I  am  red  text < / p > \n < p style = \"color:green;\" > I  am  green  text < / p > \n < p style = \"color:yellow;\" > I  am  yellow  text < / p > As you can see, We write a simple example.

HTML < p style = \"color:red; background-color: gray; font-size: 25px;\" >  Lorem  ipsum  dolor  sit  amet.  < / p >   Code preview As you can see we change the background color of the text. if You look carefully, you will see some white space around the text.

First, we need a defined which HTML element we are going to style, For that we need to create some class & id (should not be repeated) even though we can style by selecting an HTML element. Text Color:- Hello World Lorem ipsum... Ut wisi enim... Example HTML < p style = \"color:Tomato;\" > Hello  World </p> \n < p style = \"color:DodgerBlue;\" > Lorem  ipsum... </p> \n < p style = \"color:MediumSeaGreen;\" > Ut  wisi  enim... < / p >"
